This is a Spine Toolbox 'project'. First install [Spine Toolbox](https://github.com/Spine-project/Spine-Toolbox), then open this repository from Spine Toolbox.

You will also need to install the models used in the Toolbox workflow.

- Backbone can be installed from here: [Backbone](https://gitlab.vtt.fi/backbone/backbone). However, you will also need [GAMS](https://www.gams.com/download/), which is a commercial modelling language. You will also need to inform Spine Toolbox where the local GAMS executable is (File -> Settings -> Tools).
